     * SpongeCommon's MixinNetHandlerPlayServer.onDisconnectHandler fires the
     * event already.
     *
     * There is a special case where this event is reinstated - if Sponge's
     * ClientConnectionEvent#Login event is cancelled - which we can detect
     * because the EntityPlayerMP's NetHandlerPlayServer has not been
     * reinstated at this stage. In that scenario, we fire Forge's event as a
     * matter of compatibility with mods that might have started their setup
     * with players.
     *
     * NOTE: ANY call to playerLoggedOut will need to fire the
     * PlayerLoggedOutEvent manually!
