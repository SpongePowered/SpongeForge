 * <p>Synchronous Scheduler Implementation Notes:</p>

 * interfaces for one kind of scheduler - a synchronous scheduler.</p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Synchronous is related to a clock, and by default the relationship
 * of being "synchronous" is to be in step with the Minecraft server tick event.
 * So, to be "asynchronous" means to not run on the time base of the 
 * Server Tick, but rather run on a time base that is relative, 
 * eg., the wall-clock. </p>
