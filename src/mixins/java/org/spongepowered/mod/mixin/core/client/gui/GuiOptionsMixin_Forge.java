/**
 * In Sponge's Multi-World implementation, we give each world its own {@link WorldInfo}. While this is a great idea all around (allows us to
 * make things world-specific), it has some unintended consequences, such as breaking being able to change your difficulty in SinglePlayer. While
 * most people would tell us to not worry about it as Sponge isn't really client-side oriented, I have no tolerance for breaking Vanilla
 * functionality (barring some exceptions) so this cannot stand.
